          <p>
            I am the learner of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything
            needed to make a website function, efficient. I didn't stop with the
            web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue
            JS.

          <p>
            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web
            developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
            it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
            Hero.
